Project Summary
This project aims to leverage Twitter data to analyze employee attrition risk by performing sentiment analysis and topic extraction using Large Language Models (LLMs). By focusing on tweets related to human resources (HR), employee well-being, and workplace discussions, the project generates insights into common concerns, sentiment trends, and key topics. This model can be adapted for broader HR-related discussions or any business challenge reflected in social media activity.

Key Components
Data Collection: Leveraging the Twitter API v2 to gather real-time tweets related to keywords such as "employee attrition risk," "HR," or "workplace." This will be used to capture the most recent conversations related to employee sentiment.

Sentiment Analysis: Using a transformer-based LLM model to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, providing a deeper understanding of the overall mood.

Topic Extraction: Employing a generative LLM to identify core topics from each tweet, allowing the discovery of frequent themes and concerns in HR and workplace discussions.

Visualization: Graphical representation of key findings, including sentiment polarity, dominant topics, and tweet frequency trends.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains tweets retrieved using the Twitter API v2, based on queries such as "employee attrition risk," "HR," or "workplace," filtered for English-language tweets. The dataset includes:

Timestamp: When the tweet was posted.
Author_ID: Unique identifier for the tweetâ€™s author.
Tweet Content: The text of the tweet.
Data Processing Pipeline
Tweet Preprocessing:

Removal of special characters, URLs, mentions, and stop words.
Tokenization and cleaning to standardize tweet content for further analysis.
Sentiment Classification:

Using a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., GPT-2 or a sentiment-focused LLM) to assign a sentiment label (positive, negative, neutral) to each tweet.
Model validation performed using traditional machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest, for cross-validation of sentiment classification accuracy.

Topic Extraction:

Each cleaned tweet is processed by a generative LLM to detect recurring themes and topics, allowing an understanding of common discussion points, such as "workplace stress," "HR policies," and "employee satisfaction."

Model Details
Sentiment Analysis Model: Utilizes a transformer-based language model (e.g., GPT-2) trained for sentiment classification, with outputs providing sentiment labels for each tweet.

Topic Generation Model: A generative LLM (like GPT-3 or similar) is used for topic extraction. The model identifies prominent themes from tweet texts to surface the core discussions around employee attrition risk and workplace concerns.

Results and Insights
Sentiment Distribution: Visualizations will highlight the proportion of tweets classified as positive, negative, or neutral. This helps to gauge the general mood of discussions around HR and workplace-related themes.

Top Topics: 
Key topics extracted from the tweets will be displayed, focusing on trending themes like "toxic workplace culture," "HR management strategies," "job security," and "employee mental health."

Tweet Frequency Over Time: 
This plot will show tweet activity trends, revealing peaks and troughs in conversations related to employee attrition risk. Identifying these trends helps pinpoint when employee-related issues become more prominent.

Deployment
The model will be deployed using Flask, enabling the sentiment and topic generation system to be accessed via a web interface. Users can input specific queries or keywords to get real-time analysis on workplace-related topics.

Conclusions
Sentiment Insights: Understanding employee sentiment towards HR policies, workplace culture, and management practices through social media data offers a unique lens into the broader HR challenges faced by companies.

Actionable Topics: Identifying key topics of concern (e.g., job satisfaction, employee well-being, or workplace stress) enables HR departments to focus their efforts on high-impact areas for improving employee retention.
